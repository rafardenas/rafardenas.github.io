Hi! My name is Rafael, I am a Chemical Engineering student. At the moment I am a research assistant at Imperial College London, I have the fortune of working with professor [Antonio Del Rio](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.del-rio-chanona).
Broadly, I am interested in Machine Learning, specifically, I am currently working on Reinforcement Learning for control of chemical processes.

Hope you find my thoughs and posts interesting, see you around!
