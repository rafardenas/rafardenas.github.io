My Name is Rafael Cardenas, at the moment I am a student of Chemical Engineering. 

My main interests are Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Applied Mathematics. Currently learning a lot about the latter on an internship in Germany.

This website serves as a vehicle to share my (hopefully interesting) ideas and in the process state them well. 
I highly encourage feedback and criticism, please, don't hesitate contacting me about any matter.
